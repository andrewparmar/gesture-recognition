A random selection should have a mean accuracy of 50\%. The predictions with the naive classifier definitely perform better. The average performance over six runs using a split p=0.8 and k=7 is ~64\%. Using k values lower than 5 showed a reduction in accuracy. The accuracy plateaus around k=7.\\
The p value doesn't appear to be as sensitive to the accuracy. Using a value of p=0.4 still provided an average accuracy of 64\%, and accuracy values of ~50\% for p as low as 0.2. Raising p to greater than 0.5 showed no significant improvements in accuracy.
