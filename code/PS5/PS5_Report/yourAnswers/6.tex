The target moves closer and further to the camera throughout the frame sequence. This prompted me to use MDParticleFilter so that scale could be incorporated. I used some of the tricks learned in part 5, mainly to use a smaller template zone, specifically this target's torso area. The camera also stays to the the left of the target for the most part so I was able to get away with using a fixed template rather than using an alpha value for changing appearance.\\

I didn't need to modify run\_particle\_filter for this part, it worked as is.
