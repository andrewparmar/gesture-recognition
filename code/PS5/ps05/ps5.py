        These steps will calculate the weighted mean. The resulting values
        should represent the tracking window center point.

        In order to visualize the tracker's behavior you will need to overlay
        each successive frame with the following elements:

        - Every particle's (x, y) location in the distribution should be
          plotted by drawing a colored dot point on the image. Remember that
          this should be the center of the window, not the corner.
        - Draw the rectangle of the tracking window associated with the
          Bayesian estimate for the current location which is simply the
          weighted mean of the (x, y) of the particles.
        - Finally we need to get some sense of the standard deviation or
          spread of the distribution. First, find the distance of every
          particle to the weighted mean. Next, take the weighted sum of these
          distances and plot a circle centered at the weighted mean with this
          radius.
