Negative values in an image means that the data type the image is represented by allows negative values, and that 0 in this frame of reference is not black, but rather an inbetween value. Cutting off these negative values can result in loss of detail of the image. If required, these should be normalized so that they are converted to a more standardized range, like [0, 255]
