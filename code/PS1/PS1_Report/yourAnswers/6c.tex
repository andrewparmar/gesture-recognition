After adding noise to the green and blue channels, the image with noise on the blue channel looks better. The colors seem to be closer to the original than the green channel image. I believe this is because the eye can spot more pixels in the green spectrum of lift and therefore perceives more noise than in the blue channel's case. This has the effect of making the image appear more grainy, and different from the original. I could start seeing a noticeable difference in quality of the images at around 7 sigma.
