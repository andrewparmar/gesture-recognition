LK seems to start performing poorly for large displacements, and seems to get progressively worse the larger the displacement gets.

My Lukas-Kanade optic flow implementation already included a derivative blurring step. This blur used a gaussian kernel. I had to double the sigma value for this kernel (double compared to part 1a) to generate a smoother quiver plot.
